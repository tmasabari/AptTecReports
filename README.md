# Background: Challenges Faced by Legacy or Server-Side Reporting

Legacy or server-side reporting solutions have long been plagued by various challenges that hinder their efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Below are some of the key issues faced by these systems:

1.  **Heavy Cost Involved on Generating Content on Server Side:** Legacy reporting systems often require substantial investment in hardware and infrastructure to generate reports on the server side. This includes the cost of powerful servers, storage, and maintenance.
    
2.  **Licensing Fees:** Many server-side reporting solutions come with expensive licensing fees, adding to the overall cost of implementing and maintaining the reporting system.
    
3.  **Lack of Flexibility for Users to Change Layout after Previewing Data:** Users often face limitations in modifying report layouts once they have previewed the data. This lack of flexibility can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when specific adjustments are required.
    
4.  **Inability to Adjust Column Sizes and Sorting Options:** Legacy reporting systems may not allow users to easily adjust column sizes or sort data by different columns, leading to less user-friendly and interactive reports.
    
5.  **Paper Waste Due to Fixed Column Margins for Variable Length Data:** Fixed column margins in server-side reports can result in excessive paper usage when dealing with data of varying lengths. This inefficiency can lead to wastage and environmental concerns.
    
6.  **Challenges with Multi-Tenancy Reporting:** Handling multi-tenancy reporting can be complex and laborious with server-side solutions. Different tenants or clients often request slightly modified versions of the same report, which may require duplicate reporting designs or convoluted logic to manage efficiently.
    
7.  **Complex Code Maintenance:** Managing and maintaining server-side reporting systems can be intricate and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex code structures to cater to different reporting requirements.
    

These issues collectively contribute to the limitations and inefficiencies of legacy or server-side reporting, making it essential to explore more modern and flexible reporting solutions to overcome these challenges.
